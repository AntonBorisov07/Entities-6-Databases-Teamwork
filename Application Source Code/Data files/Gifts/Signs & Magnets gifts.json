And now you can add \"finger puppet\" to the list. We find it ironic that the great Pop Artist is now a toy himself, and we think Warhol would be proud. The Andy Warhol Puppet is about 4 inches tall and is nicely detailed for such a small thing. He wears a very arty red satin jacket and black turtleneck sweater, and his head is crowned by a dramatic shock of white hair. He's also magnetized so you can stick him to your refrigerator, filing cabinet, or Campbell's Soup can. Andy Warhol once said \"An artist is somebody who produces things that people don't need to have.\" So we guess that would make us artists here at UPG.Dimensions: 10 cm","Category":{"CategoryName":"Signs & Magnets"}},{"Price":"12.90","Name":"Magnetic Finger Puppet Virginia Woolf","Description":"This Virginia Woolf finger puppet will cheer anyone up, even though she may be depressed herself.
